Introduction

Walmart is notable for being one of the largest multinational retail stores in North America and reputable for their large and spacious stores offering various products to the average consumers at a competitive price. According to an article published in 2014, Walmart discovered value in managing their inventory using weather as component of their prediction models.
Following the release of the article, Walmart launched a Kaggle competition challenging participants to predict the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products (like umbrellas, bread, and milk) around the time of major weather events at 45 of their retail locations.
The objective of this course project is to design and implement a sales prediction model by performing a regression analysis utilizing all sales and weather information provided by Walmart.

Data Overview

Walmart has provided three datasets for the challenge as following: daily Sales records, daily Weather records and a Key table linking Weather stations to stores within their area. The sales records provided total daily sales per store for 111 items for the period JAN 2012 to OCT 2014 masked into numbers only to maintain their anonymity and reduce potential prediction bias.

Regression Analysis Results

The final produced optimum models revealed that the forward selection process was successful in producing optimal prediction models for items with high unit sales quantities. On the contrast, Backward elimination was more efficient in producing models predicting items with low sales (which was represented by most of the items).

Conclusion

In conclusion, though intuitively weather typically should affect the sale of weather-sensitive items, however the analysis proved to show that weather may not be of a great influence to the behavior of consumers. The weather based sales prediction models can assist in planning stock levels better if combined with directly related consumer buying influencers such as day of week, holidays, paycheck days, and promotions.
